#### **OpenHealth**, a [web computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_computing) sandbox to explore public health data.
Live tool at https://mathbiol.github.io/openHealth.
All you need is 
``` HTML
<script src="https://mathbiol.github.io/openHealth/openHealth.js"></script>
```
or, if you have jQuery, 

``` javascript
$.getScript("https://mathbiol.github.io/openHealth/openHealth.js")
```
This openHealth library is being developed as a helper in interoperating with public data sources for Health data. This JavaScript library creates a single object in the DOM namespace following the same "namespace pollution" approach common in analytical environments such as Matlab and R.
